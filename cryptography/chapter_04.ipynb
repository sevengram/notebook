    "AES consists of so-called layers. Each layer manipulates all 128 bits of the data path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Addition layer** A 128-bit round key, or subkey, which has been derived from the main key in the key schedule, is XORed to the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Byte Substitution layer (S-Box)** Each element of the state is nonlinearly transformed using lookup tables with special mathematical properties. This introduces *confusion* to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffusion layer** It provides diffusion over all state bits. It consists of two sublayers, both of which perform linear operations:\n",
    "* The *ShiftRows* layer permutes the data on a byte level.\n",
    "* The *MixColumn* layer is a matrix operation which combines (mixes) blocks of four bytes."

    "* AES is a modern block cipher which supports three key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bit. It provides excellent long-term security against brute-force attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AES has been studied intensively since the late 1990s and no attacks have been found that are better than brute-force.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AES is not based on Feistel networks. Its basic operations use Galois field arithmetic and provide strong diffusion and confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AES is efficient in software and hardware."
